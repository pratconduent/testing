The forest was alive with the gentle hum of nature, where towering trees stretched toward the sky like ancient guardians. Sunlight filtered through the dense canopy, scattering golden patches across the moss-covered ground. A cool breeze carried the earthy scent of damp soil and wildflowers, while distant birdsong echoed like a melody woven into the fabric of the woods. Every step revealed a hidden detail—a cluster of mushrooms, a glistening spiderweb, or the ripple of a stream winding silently through the undergrowth. It was a world untouched by haste, a sanctuary where time seemed to pause.
